# Mux-FSM-DataBus-inversor
 The following code shows the implementation of a finite state machine (fsm) and a parameterized Mux that receives an input bus of size BUS_DATA_SIZE and is divided into WORD_NUM words of size WORD_SIZE. This bus is inverted at the output, for example, if 0xABCD is received, 0xDCBA is obtained at the output.
